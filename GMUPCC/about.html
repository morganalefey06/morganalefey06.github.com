<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen  the Metropolitan  Museum  of Art opened  in 1880  on the east side of New York City's Central Park, it was given an endowment to fund a collection of plaster casts molded from original sculptures  in the great museums  of Europe.   The Metropolitan  assembled  a superb collection of 2,600 plaster casts, most of them made between 1880 and 1900.  After that,  however,  the  Metropolitan   Museum  curators  spent  more  and  more  money  on acquiring  original works of art, resulting in the declined interest in plaster.<br/> </p>
<hr />
<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>y 1930, the plaster  casts  had  been  placed  in storage.    In 2003,  a selection  of these  casts  arrived  at George Mason University  on long-term  loan from the Metropolitan  Museum of Art. Two more shipments arrived in 2005, bringing the total number of casts at GMU to more than 60. The casts are to be gifts from the MET. They have undergone cleaning and restoration,and they are installed in buildings on the campus. <br/></p>
