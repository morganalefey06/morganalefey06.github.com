<p style="font-size:20pt;">Barberini Faun, late third – early second century BCE</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">Munich, Glyptothek</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">Marble</p>

The statue represents a sleeping Faun, a mythical woodland creature that looks like a human with a tail and was a follower of Bacchus.   Fauns were known in Classical times for wild drinking and uncontrolled carousing in the wild.   The faun depicted here has dropped  his pan-pipes  behind  the rock  on which  he
lies asleep, splayed out on his clothing, a panther-skin with gaping jaws.  The faun’s brow is knitted  and  his  mouth  is  slightly  open,  suggesting  that  his  drunken  sleep  is  not  very comfortable.</br>

The marble  statue  of the Faun was dug up in Rome  in the 1620’s,  during  Pope Urban VIII’s  fortification   of  the  Castel  Sant’Angelo.     The  Castel  was  built  originally   as  a Mausoleum   for  the  Emperor   Hadrian   in  the  2nd    century  BCE  and  decorated   with numerous  statues,  including  the  Barberini  Faun.    Urban  VIII’s  family,  the  Barberini family,  owned  the  statue  after  it  was  found.    During  the  17th   and  18th   centuries,  the Barberini Faun became one of the most famous antique statues in Rome.  Perhaps the fact that it was poorly preserved made it even more tantalizing for artists and connoisseurs.   A number  of different  artists adjusted  the statue’s  posture,  and restored  and re-restored  its missing parts, including  the right leg, the left arm, the fingers of the right hand, and the base.  The fig-leaf was added during the 1600’s.</br>

During the French occupation of Italy, the members of the Barberini family were forced to sell the statue.  Despite strenuous resistance to its export, the statue was sold to Ludwig I of Bavaria in 1814.  It arrived in Munich in 1820, where a special room was built for it in the Glyptothek, where it remains today.</p>
